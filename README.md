 Integrate transcriptome, metabolome changes in TNBC cells upon IRE1 inhibition


# IRE1 signalling in Breast Cancer

* Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) display constitutive IRE1 signalling activation. Chronic “aberrant” IRE1 signalling may contribute to progression and therapy resistance in the most aggressive breast cancer subtype.

* Identify metabolic impact of IRE1 signalling in TNBC. Characterize changes potentially contributing to disease progression. 

* Due to the intricacy of this regulatory network the understanding of its role from the study of individual signalling events is sometimes difficult

# Identifying IRE1 imprint on TNBC metabolic landscape

We utilize a selective IRE1 inhibitor (MKC8866) to “switch off” IRE1 signalling, and compare changes at transcriptome/ miRNA / metabolome level upon switching on/off IRE1.
